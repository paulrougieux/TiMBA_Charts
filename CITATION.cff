  This package can be used as a toolkit for analysing TiMBA results after simulation.
  The package provides a dashboard which let the user interact with the main TiMBA results. 
  This includes the development of prices, production, consumption, and trade of forest products 
  as well as forest stock development. It also gives information about historic developments as 
  reported by the FAOSTAT. In principle, the toolkit can be easily adapted and used for the 
  analysis of any forest sector model as long as the data resembles the format of the TiMBA output.
